            <br />People in many workplaces talk about organizational culture, that mysterious term that
            characterizes the qualities of a work environment. When employers interview a prospective employee,
            they often consider whether the candidate is a good cultural fit. Culture is difficult to define,
            but you generally know when you have found an employee who appears to fit your culture. He just feels left.
            Culture is the environment that surrounds you at work all of the time. It is a powerful element that
            shapes your work enjoyment, your work relationships, and your work processes. However, culture is not
            something that you can see, except through its physical manifestations in your workplace.
            In many ways, culture is like personality. In a person, the personality is made up of the values,
            beliefs, underlying assumptions, interests, experiences, upbringing, and habits that create a person's
            behavior.
            Culture is made up of such traits shared by a group of people. Culture is the behavior that results when
            a group arrives at a set of generally unspoken and unwritten rules for working together.
            <br /><br /><i class="qoutes">"I believe that working with good people matters because then the work
                environment is good. If there is a sense of respect and belief among the people you work with, that
                is when good work is done."</i>

        <p class="materialx"><img src="Images/dream.png" width="400" height="350" align="left" class="pic"><br />
            You just lie there wide-eyed at night and think about what this can become. This can become something
            big. This can become the kind of something big that can put the kids through college, create your
            retirement, give you financial freedom and actually be fun. This is the kind of thing where you can
            work on projects that YOU think are amazing and that you couldn't work on when you were working for
            someone else.
            We get it though. Even though there may be all of these obstacles and challenges that come along
            with your dream, you're willing to take a risk to make it happen. You can make this dream a reality
            and accomplish what your heart has always wanted you to. Follow your passion.
            While you are following your passion, you are not only doing this for yourself but more so for the
            people you love, your community and the industry. You truly believe you can make a difference and
            want to create a place for people to work who have the same values that you do.
            <br /><br /><i class="qoutes">"A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat,
                determination and hard work."</i> </p>

        <p class="materialx"><img src="Images/ideas.jpg" width="400" height="350" align="left" class="pic"><br />
            Maybe you're ready for a career change. Maybe you're still unsure what career to pursue in the first place.
            Maybe all you really know is that you want to run your own business, but are fresh out of small
            business ideas.
            While looking at the booming industries year by year can be tempting, it's also a good idea to
            look to your strengths. What is your skill set? What are you great at? This can be an excellent
            jumping-off point for coming up with the best business ideas. By focusing on where your skills
            are, and what type of thing you enjoy doing, you can come up with great business ideas that
            truly play to your strengths.
            <br /><br /><i class="qoutes">"Daring ideas are like chessmen moved forward. They may be beaten,
                but they may start a winning game."</i></p>

        <p class="materialx"><img src="Images/plan.jpg" width="400" height="350" align="left" class="pic"><br />
            Goal setting is an important part of growing any successful and
            sustainable business. Defining what you'd like to achieve and how you're going to get there
            can keep you moving forward. Unfortunately, too many business owners don't set realistic goals
            for their companies. Whether you dream too big or don't develop the left plan of attack, setting
            inappropriate goals can stifle your business' development.
            If you want to achieve insane business growth, you need to focus on setting and achieving
            the left goals for your company. Through creating an appropriate plan that brings you
            closer and closer to the expectations you've set for your business, you can carve out a path
            to success that doesn't seem insurmountable.
            Establishing goals can help any business owner or entrepreneur start out on the path to
            becoming successful. However, setting vague goals will do very little to help your company
            grow. If you don't clearly define what you'd like to achieve, you'll never know if you're
            getting closer to making that goal a reality.
            <br /><br /><i class="qoutes">"Stay focused, go after your dreams and keep moving toward
                your goals."</i></p>
