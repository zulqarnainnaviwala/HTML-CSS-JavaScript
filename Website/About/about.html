    <h2 class="h2">HISTORY:</h2>
    <p class="material">MAK Computers, Inc. was founded on January 2, 2018, by Moosa A.K who brought to the new company
        a vision of changing the way people viewed Software. Moosa A.K
        wanted to make software small enough for people to have them in their easy assisable. Simply put, they wanted
        a software that was user-friendly.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="h2">BRAND LOYALTY</h2>
    <p class="material">MAK customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history.
        There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say MAK isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people
        who say MAK isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of
        noncontradiction where MAK is concerned.
        MAK is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... MAK is one guy
        in a home undertaking the mission of bringing softwares power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary
        individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from one guy to a billion-dollar corporation
        exemplifies the Pakistani Dream. Even as a large corporation.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="h2">STORES</h2>
    <p class="material">
        The first MAK Stores were originally opened as two locations in Mach 2019 by then-CEO Moosa A.K, after a one
        year of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the
        company's products, he began an effort in 2018 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to
        consumers, . Moosa A.K also known as "MAK" relaunched MAK's online store in 2018, and opened the first one
        physical store in 2019. The media initially speculated that MAK would fail, but its stores were highly
        successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within one year reached US$0.5 billion
        in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer. Over the year, MAK has expanded the number of retail locations 
        and its geographical coverage, with 200 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2019.

    <h2 class="h2">PRIVACY STANCE</h2>
    <p class="material">MAK has a notable pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings
        part of its conferences,promotional campaigns, and public image. With its Softawre mobile & computer , the
        MAK began a technique at the end of 2018 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's 
        local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to MAK's MAKTORE storage system. It also introduced
        "differential privacy", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous,
        in a system that Wired described as "trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible
        about any individual in it". Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.
        However, MAK aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing MAKTORE backups of users' devices, and the company's 
        commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer softwares 
        models, which don't have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.
